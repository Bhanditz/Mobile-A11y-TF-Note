<h2>User Agent and Assistive Technology Support Notes</h2>
<p>Some user agents may not support specific keyboard layouts and some custom virtual keyboards may not support specific virtual keyboard layouts.  Some users such as users of screen readers may be confused by different keyboard layouts or keyboards that might appear.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this technique is to assist the user by displaying relevant virtual keyboard or keyboard layout based on input type.   Specifying the most specific input type
will assist users with virtual keyboards displaying the most relevant keys and enabling or disabling features such as spell check and 
auto capitalization.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
This technique uses the HTML5 <code>type</code> attribute attribute for text input to provide more specific
virtual keyboard context.  For example, use of type=email may display an alphanumeric keyobard with
inclusion of common characters such as @ sign and may disable auto capitalizationa and spell check.

Other input types that may change the appearnce of the virtual keyboard.
type=date: may display a date picker and no virtual keyobard or a date picker and virtula keyboard
type=datetime: standard alphanumeric keyboard displayed by most user agents

type=month:may display a month picker and no virtual keyobard or a month picker and virtula keyboard
type=number:may display a numeric virtual keyobard or a spinner and virtual keyboard
type=range: may not display a virtual keyobard.  Displays a slider.
type=tel:may display a numeric virtual keyobard 
type=time:may display a time picker and no virtual keyobard or a time picker and virtual keyboard
type=url:may display a url virtual keyobard 
type=week: may display a week picker and no virtual keyobard or a week picker and virtual keyboard
